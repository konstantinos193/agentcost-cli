🐦 Twitter Thread:
1/ Surprise AI bills are real. Built AgentCost to track Claude/OpenAI/Cursor costs in real-time. Show thread 👇

2/ The problem: Dev teams using Claude, Cursor, Copilot have NO visibility into costs until the bill arrives. $100s, sometimes $1000s surprise.

3/ So I built AgentCost CLI - tracks every AI call with real token counts and actual pricing. No more surprises.

4/ Demo: agentcost claude "Implement auth" → Shows real tokens, cost, response. Works with Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Copilot.

5/ Why this matters: Teams can now budget, optimize prompts, and actually know their AI ROI.

6/ Free CLI available now. Pro version coming with dashboard, team features, budget alerts.

7/ GitHub: github.com/your-org/agentcost-cli

Try it out and let me know what you think! 🚀

Title: Show HN: AgentCost CLI - Track your AI coding agent costs in real-time

Text: Hi HN, 

I built AgentCost because my team's AI coding agent bills were getting out of control. We were using Claude, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot but had no visibility into actual costs until the credit card bill arrived.

AgentCost is a CLI tool that:
- Calls real AI APIs (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Copilot)
- Tracks exact token usage from API responses
- Calculates costs using real model pricing
- Shows per-model breakdown and totals
- Works locally with JSON storage (no dependencies)

Example:
$ agentcost claude "Implement user authentication"
🤖 Calling claude API...
📊 Tokens: 245 input + 380 output = 625 total
💰 Actual cost: $0.0094

$ agentcost stats
📊 AgentCost Statistics
claude-3.5-sonnet: 15 calls, 12,500 tokens, $4.25
gpt-4-turbo: 8 calls, 8,200 tokens, $2.18
TOTAL: 46 calls, 21,850 tokens, $6.55

The CLI is free and open source. I'm working on a Pro version with web dashboard, team collaboration, and budget alerts.

GitHub: github.com/your-org/agentcost-cli

Would love to hear your feedback - is this a problem you've faced? What features would you need?
