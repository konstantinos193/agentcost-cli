It:

- Wraps agent execution
- Captures:
  - Token usage
  - Model used
  - Duration
  - File changes
- Logs locally in SQLite

---

### 2. Cost Dashboard (Web UI)

Minimal dashboard:

- Total tokens
- Cost by:
  - Day
  - Developer
  - Repository
- Cost per task

No overengineering.

---

### 3. Team Mode (Basic)

- Dev logs in
- CLI sends usage data to hosted backend
- Dashboard aggregates per team

That’s it.

No memory.
No compliance.
No advanced analytics.

Keep it focused.

# 4. Tech Stack

## Backend
- Node.js / Bun
- PostgreSQL
- Simple REST API

## Frontend
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Basic charts (Recharts)

## CLI
- Node CLI tool
- Uses child_process to wrap agents

Keep architecture simple.

---

# 5. Pricing Strategy

## Free Tier
- Single user
- Local storage only
- Basic cost tracking

## Pro Tier ($29–49 per dev / month)
- Hosted dashboard
- Team aggregation
- Historical analytics
- Export reports

## Team Tier ($99+/month minimum)
- Admin controls
- Usage reports
- Slack notifications
- Budget alerts

---

# 6. Distribution Strategy

## Phase 1: Open-Source Hook

Create:
“agentcost-cli” on GitHub

Free:
- Local tracking
- Cost estimation

This builds trust.

---

## Phase 2: Content Strategy

Post weekly:

- “How much Claude actually costs per sprint”
- “We analyzed 1M tokens across 10 devs”
- “AI coding ROI breakdown”

People love cost transparency.

---

## Phase 3: Direct Outreach

Find:
- YC startups
- AI-heavy dev teams

Message:
“We built a tool to track AI coding agent spend and ROI. Want early access?”

Offer 30-day free pilot.

---

# 7. Expansion (After First Paying Users)

Only after revenue:

Add:

- Budget alerts
- Token inefficiency detection
- Prompt optimization insights
- “High burn tasks” detection
- Team productivity comparison

Later:
- Security layer
- Compliance logs
- SOC exports

---

# 8. Revenue Milestones

## Month 1
- MVP live
- 10 beta users

## Month 2–3
- First 3 paying teams
- $1k–3k MRR

## Month 4–6
- 10+ paying teams
- $10k+ MRR

---

# 9. What NOT To Do

Do NOT:

- Build full enterprise security immediately
- Build massive memory systems
- Add AI features before revenue
- Overdesign architecture
- Wait for perfection

Ship fast.
Charge early.
Iterate based on paying users.

---

# 10. Weekly Execution Plan

## Week 1
- Validate demand
- Sketch architecture
- Design pricing

## Week 2
- Build CLI wrapper
- Store usage locally

## Week 3
- Build dashboard
- Connect CLI to backend

## Week 4
- Invite beta users
- Fix friction
- Start charging

---

# Final Rule

Do not chase stars.
Chase paying teams.

If 20 companies depend on your tool,
your income becomes predictable.

Focus on revenue, not applause.
