# 2. Problem Validation (Week 1)

## Step 1: Market Validation

Before writing heavy code:

- Post on X / Reddit / HackerNews:
  - “How are you tracking AI coding agent costs in your team?”
  - “Is anyone auditing Claude/Codex usage across devs?”

- DM 20 developers using:
  - Claude Code
  - OpenCode
  - Codex CLI

Ask:
- Do you track usage?
- Do you know your monthly spend?
- Do you log decisions?
- Would your company pay for visibility?

Goal:
Get 5–10 real conversations.

If at least 3 say “we need this” → proceed aggressively.
